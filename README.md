Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language you like.
A new set of puzzles is supplied every day as the advent of that day.

If you are interested in the problems, you can find them ***[here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/events)***.

I did this to get more familiar with **Python**, problems related to coding and for fun of course.

## ðŸ”¨ To improve

For now, I chose the most intuitive approach.
Next, think about coming up with more efficient solutions: better time and space complexities.
